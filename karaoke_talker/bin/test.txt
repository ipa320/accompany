2000 [start]
1000 Dashing through the snow
1000 In a one-horse open sleigh
1000 O'er the fields we go
1000 Laughing all the way
1000 Bells on bob tails ring
1000 Making spirits bright
1000 What fun it is to laugh and sing
1000 A sleighing song tonight. Oh,
1000 Jingle bells, jingle bells
1000 Jingle all the way
1000 Oh What fun it is to ride
1000 In a one-horse open sleigh. Oh,
1000 Jingle bells, jingle bells
1000 Jingle all the way 
1000 Oh what fun it is to ride
1000 In a one-horse open sleigh.
1000 A day or two ago
1000 I thought i'd take a ride
1000 And soon miss fanny bright
1000 Was seated by my side
1000 The horse was lean and lank
1000 Misfortune seemed his lot
1000 He got into a drifted bank And we, we got up sot
1000 Jingle bells, jingle bells
1000 Jingle all the way
1000 Oh What fun it is to ride
1000 In a one-horse open sleigh. hey,
1000 Jingle bells, jingle bells
1000 Jingle all the way 
1000 Oh what fun it is to ride
1000 In a one-horse open sleigh.
1000 Now the ground is white
1000 So go it while you're young 
1000 Take the girls tonight
1000 and sing this sleighing song
1000 Just get a bob-tailed bay
1000 Two-fourty for his speed
1000 Hitch him to an open sleigh and crack
1000 You'll take the lead
1000 Jingle bells, jingle bells
1000 Jingle all the way
1000 Oh What fun it is to ride
1000 In a one-horse open sleigh. hey,
1000 Jingle bells, jingle bells
1000 Jingle all the way 
1000 Oh what fun it is to ride
1000 In a one-horse open sleigh.
