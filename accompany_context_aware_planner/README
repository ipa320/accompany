1.Make sure mysql connector for c++ is install. Download the "source code" for the c++ version of the Connector/C++ from 

	http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/#downloads

  The latest version tested was mysql-connector-c++-1.1.3.tar.gz
  
  Extract the file with 
	>tar xfvz mysql-connector-c++-1.1.3.tar.gz

  Follow the installation instractions from the "INSTALL" file in the extracted folder to compile and install the library and the include files.

2.To compile this package, go into the package root directory (i.e. accompany_context_aware_planner folder) and execute the following command

	> make

3.To test this package, you need access to robot house mysql database. You can easilly clone this to your local machine. 

  The package is currently set to search for the database on the local machine i.e. #define DBHOST "tcp://localhost:3306"

  However, you can easily reconfigure this package to use your MYSQL Server by modify and uncomment the MySQL server setting in thelaunch file:
	
	accompany_context_aware_planner/ros/launch/accompany_context_aware_planner.launch

  	 	
4.To make eclipse project files for this package, follow the instructions @ http://www.ros.org/wiki/IDEs#Creating_the_Eclipse_project_files
  A summary of the instructions is listed below.

  a)Execute the following command in the package root folder (i.e. accompany_context_aware_planner folder)

	>make eclipse-project

  b)Then start Eclipse, select File --> Import --> General --> Existing projects into workspace, 
	hit next, then browse for your package's directory (select root directory i.e. accompany_context_aware_planner). 
	Do NOT select Copy projects into workspace. Then finish. 

=======================================================================
Usage:
  Running the server
	>roslaunch accompany_context_aware_planner accompany_context_aware_planner.launch 

  Testing: running the client with the following parameters "userId userPosture X(m) Y(m) Orientation(deg) robotGenericTaskId"
	i.e. bin$./getPotentialProxemicsLocations 1 1 0 0 0 3
	
//Proxemics Context Aware Planner Server currently require the client to send userId, userPosture, coordinate(x,y,theta) 
// and the task the robot is going to do. 
// In the future, only userId and robot's task are needed, the rest of the data will be retrieved directly from the database.
